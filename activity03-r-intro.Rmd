Today you will be creating and manipulating vectors, lists, and data frames to uncover a top secret message.

As you work through this document with your Team members, remember to:

- Ask questions
- Google is your friend!
  If an error is confusing, copy it into Google and see what other people are saying.
  If you don't know how to do something, search for it.
- Just because there is no error message doesn't mean everything went smoothly.
  Use the console to check each step and make sure you have accomplished what you wanted to accomplish.

Do not edit this first R code chunk.
This will allow you to knit your document and view errors within the knitted report.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)
```

### Setup

Each of the following R chunks will cause an error and/or do the desired task incorrectly.  Find the mistake, and correct it to complete the intended action.

Create three vectors that contain: 1) the lower case letters, 2) the lower case letters, and 3) some punctuation marks.

```{r}
lower_case <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z")

upper_case <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z")

punctuation <- c(".", ",", "!", "?", "'", "\"", "(", ")", " ", "-", ";", ":")
```



Comment on what you noticed about the errors and how you used this information to correct the issues.

**Response**: The first error in upper_case is due to a miss comma between "H" and "I". We correct this by inserting the comma.

Also there is the error in punctuation due to a special character """, we correct this by escaping with a backslash \ to make it "\"".


Make one long vector containing all the symbols.

```{r}
my_symbols <- c(lower_case, upper_case, punctuation)
```

Comment on what you noticed about the errors and how you used this information to correct the issues.

**Response**: When using cbind() the output was that number of rows was not a multiple of the vector length. I used c() instead of cbind() to join the vectors


Turn the `my_symbols` vector into a data frame, with the variable name "Symbol".

```{r}
my_symbols <- data.frame(my_symbols)
names(my_symbols) <-  "Symbol"
```

Comment on what you noticed about the errors and how you used this information to correct the issues.

**Response**: We need to use data.frame function because dataframe is not a function. Also, the variable name "Symbol" needed to be enclosed in double quotes to amke it a string since Symbol was not assigned to anything and so could not be found.


Find the total number of symbols we have in our data frame.  

```{r}
len <- nrow(Symbol)
```

Comment on what you noticed about the errors and how you used this information to correct the issues.

**Response**: There are no errors displayed. However, we don't get the actual length of the dataframe. From the output there are 64 observations but len shows only 1. The length() works for vectors and not for data frames. In this case, we need to count the number of rows. We will use nrow() function. There are 64 rows.


5. Create a new variable in your dataframe that assigns a number to each symbol.

```{r}
my_symbols$Num <- 1:len
```

Comment on what you noticed about the errors and how you used this information to correct the issues.

**Response**:
There is an error that there is unexpected in put, there is a red spot below % and that could be the problem. To extract information from or create a new variable to the data frame, we use $ operator.

'''{r}
my_symbols$Num <- 1:len
'''

The remainder of this activity will help to expand these Base R commands and I will post a solution on Blackboard by the end of class.


### Decoding the secret message.

This chunk will load up the encoded secret message data and assign it as a vector.
There are no errors here.

```{r}
# Read in full csv file
top_secret <- readr::read_csv("data/secret_code.csv", col_names = FALSE)

# Pick off only the column X1
top_secret <- top_secret[[X1]]
is.atomic(top_secret)
```
# I got an error trying to use $ operator to access the X1 column elements. I will use [[]] notation

By altering this top secret set of numbers, you will be able to create a message.
Write your own code to complete the steps below.

1. Add 14 to every number.
2. Multiply every number by 18, then subtract 257.
3. Exponentiate every number.  (You may need to Google how to this in R!)
4. Square every number.

```{r}
# Part 1
top_secret <- top_secret + 14

# Part 2
top_secret <- top_secret * 18 - 257

# Part 3
top_secret <- exp(top_secret)

# Part 4
top_secret <- top_secret ^ 2

sum(top_secret < 17)
```

**HQ UPDATE:** Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, there should be 496 numbers in the secret message that are below 17.

I got 1255 numbers

5. Turn your vector of numbers into a matrix with 5 columns.
6. Separately from your top secret numbers, create a vector of all the even numbers between 1 and 502. Name it "`evens`". That is, `evens` should be an R object that contain the values 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 502.
7. Subtract the "evens" vector from the first column of your secret message matrix.
8. Subtract 100 from all numbers 18-24th rows of the 3rd column.
9. Multiply all numbers in the 4th and 5th column by 2.
10. Turn your matrix back into a vector.

```{r}
# Part 5
top_secret <- matrix(top_secret, ncol = 5)

# Part 6
evens <- seq(from = 2, to = 502, by = 2)

# Part 7
top_secret[,1] - top_secret[,1] - evens

# Part 8
top_secret[18:24,3] <- top_secret[18:24,3] - 100

# Part 9
top_secret[,4:5] <- top_secret[,4:5] * 2

# Part 10
top_secret <- c(top_secret)
```

**HQ UPDATE:** Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, all numbers in indices 500 and beyond are below 100.

11. Take the square root of all numbers in indices 38 to 465.
12. Round all numbers to the nearest whole number.
13. Replace all instances of the number 39 with 20.

```{r}
# Checking the number of indices
length(500:length(top_secret))

# Number of values below 100
sum(top_secret[500:length(top_secret)] < 100)

# Part 11 - square root of all nos. in indices 38 to 465
top_secret[38:465] <- sqrt(top_secret[38:465])

# Part 12 - rounding off to the nearest whole number
top_secret <- round(top_secret)

# Part 13 - replacing all instances of 39 with 20
top_secret[top_secret == 39] <- 20

# To check number of even numbers
sum( (top_secret %% 2) == 0 )
```

**HQ UPDATE:** Headquarters has informed you that your final message should have 421 even numbers.

**Response* I got 1255

![](README-img/noun_pause.png) **Planned Pause Point**: If things made sense, feel free to continue on while you wait. Otherwise, contact your instructor to have them verify your work.

## The secret message!

Use your final vector of numbers as indices for `my_symbols` to discover the final message, by running the following code:

```{r}
stringr::str_c(my_symbols$Symbol[top_secret], collapse = "")
```
**I got an error**

Google the first line of this message, if you do not recognize it, to see what it is.

**delete this line and comment on what on the activity as a whole**

Comment on what you noticed about the activity as a whole.

**Response**: It was insightful as I was able to learn how to manipulate vectors, lists and data frames.



Knit, then stage everything listed in your **Git** pane, commit (with a meaningful commit message), and push  to your GitHub repo.
Go to GitHub and verify that your `activity03-r-intro.Rmd` file appears as you intended it to.

You can now go back to the `README` file.
